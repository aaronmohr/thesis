                <p>The design sprints showcase my visual explorative process throughout the span of the fall term. These projects are not meant to act as resolved pieces, but more so experimental hurtles towards valuable learning outcomes that could contribute to my final piece. Each piece was made with a defined outcome and helped me to better understand my design process and map out my future directions.</p>

                <h4>Technicolour Visions of Sonic Waves</h4>
                
                <p>My first design sprint was a print research report surrounding the topic of synesthesia. At the time of production, synesthesia was the primary focus of my research topic, thus I wanted to use my research to explore the topic more thoroughly. In doing so, I gained much more insight into the psychological effects of music on the brain and how it relates to our visual stimuli. This in effect helped me better comprehend the science behind visual music and multi-sensory design as a whole.</p>
                
                <div class="image">
                
                    <img src="../images/sprints/technicolour/technicolour.png">
                    
                    <h5>Front cover of final print product.</h5>
                    
                </div>
                
                <p>One of the more expressive portions of this project revolved around a synesthetic study that I conducted on myself. I have often noticed synesthetic tendencies in the ways that I interact with music and wanted to express these ideas through visual design. Thus, I listened to a series of chords being played on a synthesizer and noted down my initial colour reaction as a way to capture the relation being formed between my visual stimuli and the auditory information being transmitted.</p>
                
                <div class="image">
                
                    <img src="../images/sprints/technicolour/technicolour-sketch.jpeg">
                    
                    <h5>Notes taken throughout the experimental process.</h5>
                    
                </div>
                
                <p>After the tests were completed, I translated the results into a visual form through a set of cards. Each card featured the chord played in both tabular and written format which were then printed on card stock of their respective colour (as per my experiment). I wanted to use the coloured paper as a way of generating an immediate connection between the music and visual response so that it was easily recognizable and understandable.</p>
                
                <p>This ultimately also helped me to find ways of demystifying the concepts of synesthesia. I re-applied this technique to a second set of cards that listed off a set of common sensation found in synesthetes with the intention that they could be mixed and matched to showcase the diversity of synesthesia. As it is quite a complex theory, I wanted to try and produce a minimal piece that reduced the overall concept to its simplest form.</p>

                <h4>Audio Visual Systems</h4>
                
                <p>My primary focus of exploration was on actively experimenting with interactive audio visual projects. Early on in the process I developed the idea of creating a system of projects that would each explore a different realm of interactive visual music. Each of the Audio Visual Systems use the same basis for interaction while exploring different concepts and methodologies that can be represented through audio visual design.</p>

                <p>Primarily using Processing, Ableton Live and web audio API as a method of construction, these projects reflect my early progress into the world of audio visual design.</p>

                <h4>AVS001 — Visual Music Sequencing</h4>
                
                <p>The first AVS project revolved around creating a live interactive music installation. The idea was based around replacing a standard interface with something more abstract to limit the users input. This allows the program to generate the primary musical sequence with the users controlling minor parameters.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>This project acted as my primary introduction to the process of creating audio visual art. It initially sparked the idea of the AVS system and allowed me to generate more ways of approaching my project.</p>

                <h4>AVS002 — Musical Colour Theory</h4>
                
                <p>AVS002 is an ambient audio visual installation based on Alexander W. Rimington’s book Colour Music: The Art of Mobile Colour. In this book, Rimington presents the idea of creating a unified language between sound and colour based on their scientific breakdown. I wanted to explore these concepts and use them as a starting point to produce live visual feedback to inputted music.</p>
                
                <div class="image">

                    <h5>Colour Music: The Art of Mobile Colour - Wallace Rimington (1912).</h5>
                    
                </div>
                
                <p>Using inputted MIDI signals, I programmed an interface that would translate musical notes into colours on the screen. The final program acted as an ambient music machine, creating an immersive, meditative experience for the user. This also allowed me to expand upon Rimington’s theories by introducing the element of colour blending. While playing singular notes would trigger the colours on Rimington’s chart, playing chords blends these colours making a more stimulating auditory and visual experience.</p>

                <h4>AVS003 — Interactive Rhythm</h4>
                
                <p>AVS003 is a web-based step sequencer meant to explore the possibilities of using the web audio API to generate audio visual installations. This project acted primarily as a technical exploration allowing myself to become more well acquainted with using these web technologies. As I anticipate the Rosy Glow project to run on web technologies, I found it to be quite useful to explore the development process.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>The project uses sound from the Roland 808 drum machine across a 16-step sequence, allowing users to generate sequenced drum loops directly in the browser. Sequences can be generated by clicking on each of the circles which is then triggered as the sequence progresses.</p>
