            <p>Rosy Glow is a multi-media project exploring the concepts of an interactive audio-visual album. The project aims to blur the relation between the auditory and visual medium, creating a cohesive work of multi-dimensional art.</p>
            
            <p>This project falls under a self-directed capstone thesis assignment that focuses on the study and practice of visual music; a concept that encapsulates the relation between auditory information and visual art. The album will reflect my studies into the world of audio visual design and explore its mergence within contemporary interaction design.</p>
            
            <p>The initial concept for this project arose from my curiosity surrounding the merge of music and design. As both a practicing musician and designer, I have often tried to find ways to blend the notions of the two disciplines in hopes of obtaining unity amongst the two. Initially, this resulted in me designing music-related projects; album artwork, show posters, etc. But as my focus as designer started to shift towards the practice of interaction design, I began to wonder how these ideas could function in an interactive state.</p>
            
            <p>Through researching these ideas, I was lead to the study of audio visual design. This practice was one that often goes under looked in the design community, typically lying solely in a more niche field within the discipline. At its core, audio visual design is a form of multi-sensory design that connects the usage of auditory and visual information. Often used as a method of responsive interaction, experiential art or live performance, audio visual design has the ability to inflict immersive qualities through design due to its multi-sensory nature.</p>
            
            <p>My autumn research period guided me towards a rich collection of media that expanded upon these ideologies quite extensively. One book that heavily influenced my research was Cornelia and Holger Lundâ€™s Audio.Visual: On Visual Music and Related Media. This book truly opened my eyes to the concept of visual music and lead me to discover a wide variety of outside sources surrounding the history and theories behind the practice. Using the resources from this book as a starting point, I expanded my reach towards a variety of differentiating sources exploring the implications, practice and psychological nature of audio visual design. </p>
            
            <p>This website acts as a look into the process behind all of my continuous exploration. Divided into sections based on research and visual exploration, it is meant to give an outlook into my preliminary experimental process in order to help define my approach towards my final artifact.</p>
